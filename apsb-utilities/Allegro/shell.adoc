GETENV [function]
   (VAR)
  C (stdlib) getenv
  (AVER (STRING VAR))

PROCESS-FINISHED-P [function]
   (PROCESS-ID)
  Return t if the process with id PROCESS-ID has finished executing
and is waiting to signal its parent that its done.  Else, return nil.
This takes advantage of non-blocking status queries.  This is much
better than Allegro's sys:os-wait.

RUN-SHELL-COMMAND [function]
   (&REST ARGS)
  Allegro-inspired shell command interface
  (AVER (LIST ARGS))

SHELL [function]
   (COMMAND &KEY (INPUT (PATHNAME "/dev/null")) (OUTPUT *STANDARD-OUTPUT*)
    (ERROR *ERROR-OUTPUT*) (IF-OUTPUT-EXISTS :ERROR)
    (IF-ERROR-OUTPUT-EXISTS :ERROR) (IGNORE-STATUS NIL))
  Run the specified unix shell command.  Wait for completion.

COMMAND is a string.

INPUT may be a stream, pathname, string, or sequence of strings.
If a stream, that stream is read, copied to a file, and that file
is used as input for the command.  If a pathname, that file is used
as input for the command.  If a sequence of strings, the strings are
written to a temporary file, a newline inserted after each string,
and the file is used as the input.  A single string is treated as a
sequence of one string.

OUTPUT may be a pathname, a lisp stream, T, or nil.  If a pathname,
the output is written to that file.  If a stream, the output from
the command is written first to a temporary file, then to the
stream.  T is shorthand for *standard-output*.  If nil, the output
is written to a temporary file, then returned as a list of strings.

Same for ERROR, except it may have the additional value :OUTPUT,
which directs ERROR to the same place as OUTPUT.

Signal an error if the command returns non-zero status and
IGNORE-STATUS is nil.  The text of the error is taken from ERROR.

The keywords :IF-OUTPUT-EXISTS and :IF-ERROR-OUTPUT-EXISTS behave
like OPEN's :IF-EXISTS keyword.  The default action for each is
to signal an error.

Return 3 values: the completion status, output-related-info, and
error-related-info.  If OUTPUT is a pathname or stream,
output-related-info is nil; if OUTPUT is nil, output-related-info
is a list of strings that are the actual output.  Error-related-info
is just like output-related-info.  When error is :output,
error-related-info is nil.

WRITE-STRINGS-TO-FILE [function]
   (SEQUENCE &OPTIONAL (FILENAME (TEMPNAM)))
  Write a sequence to a file, separating each element with a newline,
return the filename.

FILE-STRINGS [function]
   (FILENAME)
  Return a list of the strings, each string is one line from FILENAME.

 Test the following features of SHELL
 1. :input from
       a. /dev/null
       b. named file
       c. string
       d. sequence of strings
 2. :output, :error
       a. nil,  nil
       b. nil,  /dev/null"
       c. nil,  :output
       d. /dev/null,  nil
       e. /dev/null,  :output
       f. named file, named file
       g. stream,  stream


PERL-SCRIPT [function]
   (STATUS)
  create and return perl script/string
  (AVER (FIXNUM STATUS))
