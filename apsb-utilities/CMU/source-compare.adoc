 Source Compare: A 'diff' Program for Lisp **********************
 ****************************************************************
 
 Source Compare is a common-lisp portable tool for comparing 
 lisp source files, similar to the unix program 'diff'. Like diff
 it can ignore case, whitespace, and blank lines. In addition,
 it can also ignore certain classes of lisp comments. It runs in
 average-case O(m+n) time.

 To Do **************************
 ********************************

 Extend so it can ignore documentation strings?

 Extend so it can ignore ALL whitespace (even within line)?

 Cache start and end positions for each line? [Modify line-start and
 line-end to first check the cache before redoing the computation.]
    run the profiler on this code first, though.

 The file cache could be flushed after each loop in so-co. Possibly
 worth doing to save space and/or reduce consing.

 Implement diff's O(p log n) algorithm using 2-3 trees and k-candidates.

 Given that in diff's find-merge-split algorithm the merge is on two
 sets, one with elements less than the others, can we find a way to
 do the find-find-split-merge in constant time? At least keep a table
 of whether r-1,r are in the same k-candidate set. 

 Fancy indexing, div&conq, straight-line dist to TR corner metric.
 Hierarchical LCS (i.e., abstract level first)?

 Make it aware of which definition it is in to aid matching. (Problem,
 then, of function and variable renaming.)

 Documentation **************************************************
 ****************************************************************

 Source Compare is a common-lisp portable tool for comparing 
 lisp source files, similar to the unix program 'diff'. 

 It uses a greedy variation of the usual dynamic programming 
 implementation of LCS (longest common substring) to do the 
 comparison. It tries to maintain the two files being compared
 in sync, and when a difference is encountered, uses the closest
 next match, where distance is minimized against some metric.
 Note that since this is a greedy algorithm, it is possible that it
 will not find the optimum global match sequence. However, this case
 hardly ever occurs in practice, and if it does ever occur, the
 algorithm errs on the side of safety.

 Metrics should be chosen so that minimizing distance is
 equivalent to minimizing the edits necessary to bring the two
 files into agreement. Two such metrics include
     x + y    = *total* additions and deletions from both files
     max(x,y) = length of largest addition or deletion from either file
 where x is a line number from the first file and y is a line number
 from the second file. Both of these metrics are appropriate to the
 problem, since the former tries to minimize the total changes and
 the latter gives a preference to small changes.
 
 While neither metric actually builds the dynamic programming table,
 they can be considered as exploring the table in successive
 rectilinear and diagonal manners, respectively.
                        #####          #
                            #           #
                            #            #
                            #             #
 Both metrics have been implemented.

 Both of these metrics lead to a worst-case O(n^2) algorithm
 (actually, O(nm), where n is the length of the first file and
 m is the length of the second file). In practice, however, the
 algorithm seems to have linear running time. This could be a function
 of its use to compare source files, since comparing two completely
 different files would lead to worst-case behavior. The diagonal
 metric seems to be slightly faster and less of a space hog than
 the rectilinear metric, so it has been made the default.
 
 We show below that the average case running time is O(n+m).

 ********************************
 Average Case Analysis **********
 ********************************

 Thanks to Neil J Calkin (CMU Math Department) for the idea that led to
 this proof.

 Let a(i) and b(i) be the ith distances between matches in files A and B,
 respectively. Let k, an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), be the
 number of matches. Then
	  Sum[i = 1 to k; a(i)] = m and Sum[i = 1 to k; b(i)] = n
 where m is the length in lines of file A, and n is the corresponding
 length for file B. The running time of the algorithm is proportional
 to Sum[i = 1 to k; a(i)b(i)].

 Since a(i) and b(i) are positive integers, it follows that
	    Sum[i; a(i)b(i)] <= Sum[i; a(i)] Sum[i; b(i)] = m n
 and hence the worst-case running time is O(mn). [Best case is, of course,
 linear.]

 But the worst-case running time is atypical of the average-case behavior.
 As we shall show, the average-case running time is O(m+n).

 Combining the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality
	 Sum[i;a(i)b(i)] <= Sqrt{Sum[i;a(i)^2]} sqrt{Sum[i;b(i)^2]}
 with the arithmetic-mean geometric-mean inequality
			    Sqrt{xy} <= (x+y)/2
 yields
	    Sum[i;a(i)b(i)] <= (Sum[i;a(i)^2] + Sum[i;b(i)^2])/2

 So it suffices to look at the average value of Sum[i = 1 to k; r(i)^2]
 over all possible ordered sequences r(i) of positive integers for k = 1
 to n such that Sum[i = 1 to k; r(i)] = n. Such a sequence r(k) is called a
 composition of n into k distinct parts. (The word distinct here
 signifies that permutations of a sequence r(k) are not considered
 identical -- the cells are distinct.)

 To compute this average we sum Sum[i = 1 to k; r(i)^2] over all possible
 compositions of n, and divide by the total number of such
 compositions.

 Clearly r(i) is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive). For a given
 integer i between 1 and n (inclusive), we count how often i occurs
 in a composition of n into k distinct parts. Call this count
 Comp[n,k,i]. Then the sum is equal to 
	    Sum[k = 1 to n; Sum[i = 1 to n; Comp[n,k,i] i^2]]

 Now the number of occurrences of i in the compositions of n into k
 distinct parts is the same as multiplying together the number of
 compositions of n-i into k-1 parts and the number of positions in
 which i could be inserted to form a k-part composition of n. The 
 latter quantity is clearly k. To see that the former is 
 C(n-i-1,k-2), consider n-i ones separated by (n-i)-1 spaces, and
 choose (k-1)-1 of them to form k-1 integers. Thus Comp[n,k,i] is
 k C(n-i-1,k-2).
 
 So our sum is equal to
    Sum[k = 1 to n; Sum[i = 1 to n; k(i^2)C(n-i-1,k-2)]]
	  = Sum[i = 1 to n; i^2 Sum[k = 1 to n; kC(n-i-1,k-2)]]
	  = Sum[i = 1 to n; i^2 Sum[k = 1 to n; 
                                 (k-2)C(n-i-1,k-2) + 2C(n-i-1,k-2)]]
	  = Sum[i = 1 to n; i^2 Sum[k = 1 to n; 
                                 (n-i-1)C(n-i-2,k-3) + 2C(n-i-1,k-2)]]
	  = Sum[i = 1 to n-2; i^2 (n-i-1) 2^(n-i-2)]
         + Sum[i = 1 to n; i^2 2^(n-i)]
 Substituting j = n-i+1 yields
       = Sum[j = 3 to n; (n+1-j)^2 (j-2) 2^(j-3)] 
         + Sum[j = 1 to n; (n+1-j)^2 2^(j-1)]
       = Sum[j = 1 to n-2; (n-1-j)^2 j 2^(j-1)] 
         + Sum[j = 1 to n; (n+1-j)^2 2^(j-1)]
       = (Sum[j = 1 to n-2; 2^j (j^3 - (2n-2) j^2 + (n-1)^2 j)]
          + Sum[j = 1 to n; 2^j (j^2 - (2n+2)j + (n+1)^2)])/2
 We substitute using the identities
    Sum[j = 1 to n; 2^j]     = 2^(n+1) - 2
    Sum[j = 1 to n; j 2^j]   = (n-1)2^(n+1) + 2
    Sum[j = 1 to n; j^2 2^j] = (2n^2 - 4n + 6)2^n - 6
    Sum[j = 1 to n; j^3 2^j] = (2n^3 - 6n^2 + 18n - 26)2^n + 26
 to obtain
    1/2[2^(n-1)((n-2)^3 - 3(n-2)^2 + 9(n-2) - 13 
                - 2(n-1)((n-2)^2 - 2(n-2) + 3)
                + (n-1)^2(n-3))
        2^n(2n^2 - 4n + 6
            - (2n+2)(2n-2)
            + (n+1)^2(2))
        + (26 + 6(2n-2) + 2(n-1)^2 - 6 - 2(2n+2) - 2(n+1)^2)]
 Luckily the n^3 and n^2 terms cancel, simplifying the expression to
    (3n-4) 2^(n-1) + 2
 This closed form expression has been empirically verified for n = 1 to 15.

 Since there are C(n-1,k-1) compositions of n into k distinct parts, the
 total number of compositions is Sum[k = 1 to n; C(n-1,k-1)] = 2^(n-1)
 by the binomial theorem.

 Thus the average value of Sum[n,k; r(i)^2] is the total sum divided by
 the total count, or
	     [(3n-4) 2^(n-1) + 2]/[2^(n-1)] = 3n-4 + 1/2^(n-2)
 So Sum[i; a(i)b(i)] <= (Sum[i;a(i)^2] + Sum[i;b(i)^2])/2
                      = (3n-4 + 1/2^(n-2) + 3m-4 + 1/2^(m-2))/2
                      = 3/2(n+m) - 4 + 1/2^(n-1) + 1/2^(m-1)
 on average, and hence the average case running time is O(m+n).

    text and the definition most likely to be affected by the changes. If
    PRINT-FANCY-HEADER is T, prints the file-author and file-write-date
    in the header. The report is output to OUTPUT-STREAM. Returns T if
    the files were "identical", NIL otherwise.
    If IGNORE-CASE is T, uses a case insensitive comparison.
    If IGNORE-WHITESPACE is T, ignores spaces and tabs that occur at

 *** Program Default Parameters ***

 *MINIMUM-MATCH-LENGTH* 2                                     [VARIABLE]
    The minimum number of lines that must match for it to be considered
    a match. This has the effect of collecting lots of adjacent small
    differences together into one larger difference.

 *IGNORE-WHITESPACE* t                                         [VARIABLE]
    If T, will ignore spaces and tabs that occur at the beginning of the
    line before other text appears and at the end of the line after
    the last text has appeared.

 *IGNORE-CASE* t                                               [VARIABLE]
    If T, uses a case insensitive comparison. Otherwise uses a case
    sensitive comparison.

 *IGNORE-COMMENTS* t                                           [VARIABLE]
    If T, will try to ignore comments of the semicolon variety when
    comparing lines. Tries to be rather intelligent about the context
    to avoid ignoring something that really isn't a comment. For
    example, semicolons appearing within strings, even multi-line
    strings, are not considered comment characters. Uses the following
    heuristics to decide if a semicolon is a comment character or not:
    o  Slashification (\) works inside strings ("foo\"bar")
       and symbol names (|foo\|bar|), but not balanced comments
       (#|foobar\|#).
    o  Balanced comments do not work inside strings ("#|") or
       symbol names.
    o  Strings do not work inside balanced comments (#|"|#)
    o  Regular semicolon comments do not work inside strings,
       symbol names, or balanced comments (#|foo;bar|#).
    All this is necessary for it to correctly identify when a
    semicolon indicates the beginning of a comment. Conceivably we should
    consider a semicolon as a comment when it is inside a balanced
    comment which isn't terminated from the semicolon to the end of the
    line. However, besides being complicated and time-consuming to
    implement, the lisp interpreter doesn't treat it this way, and we
    like to err on the side of caution. Anyway, changes in the comments
    within commented out regions of code is worth knowing about.

 *DONT-IGNORE-MAJOR-COMMENTS* ()                               [VARIABLE]
    If T, ignoring comments does not ignore comments with a semicolon
    at position 0 of the line.

 *IGNORE-BLANK-LINES* t                                        [VARIABLE]
    If T, will ignore blank lines when doing the comparison.

  If T, will ignore blank lines when doing the comparison.

 ********************************
 File Cache *********************
 ********************************
 File-cache is a defstruct used to cache the lines of the file as
 they are read.

FILE-CACHE [structure]

FILE-CACHE-LENGTH [function]
   (FILE)
  The number of lines cached is simply the length of the line table.
   Note that since this table has a fill-pointer, it's length is the 
   size indicated by the fill-pointer, not the array dimensions.

CACHED-LINE [function]
   (FILE LINE-NO)
  Returns a cached line from the line cache, if it exists.

CACHED-COMMENT-POSITION-INFO [function]
   (FILE LINE-NO)
  Returns the cached comment position (inside-string and 
   balanced-comment-count) information for the line, if it exists.

SET-CACHED-COMMENT-POSITION-INFO [function]
   (FILE LINE-NO INSIDE-STRING BALANCED-COMMENT-COUNT)
  Sets the cached comment position information (inside-string and
   balanced-comment-count) for the line.

GET-AND-CACHE-NEXT-LINE [function]
   (FILE)
  Gets the next line from the file, installing it in the cache.

GET-LINE [function]
   (FILE LINE-NO)
  Get the line from the file cache. If not present, get it from the stream.

WITH-OPEN-FILE-CACHED [macro]
   ((VAR FILENAME &REST OPEN-ARGS) &BODY FORMS)

 ********************************
 Line Comparison ****************
 ********************************

FIRST-NON-WHITESPACE-CHAR [function]
   (LINE &KEY FROM-END (START 0) END)
  Finds the position of the first character of LINE which is neither
   a space or a tab. Returns NIL if no character found.

LINE-START [function]
   (LINE &OPTIONAL (START 0))
  Returns the position of where in LINE to start the comparison.

*SLASH-CHAR* [variable] value: #\\
  The character used to slashify other characters.

*COMMENT-CHAR* [variable] value: #\;
  The character used to begin comments.

*STRING-QUOTES-CHAR* [variable] value: #\"
  The character used to begin and end strings.

*STRING-BAR-CHAR* [variable] value: #\|
  The character used to begin and end symbols.

*SPLAT-CHAR* [variable] value: #\#
  One of the characters used to begin balanced comments.

*BAR-CHAR* [variable] value: #\|
  One of the characters used to begin balanced comments.

FIND-COMMENT-POSITION [function]
   (LINE &OPTIONAL (START 0) END &KEY INSIDE-STRING (SPLAT-BAR-COUNT 0))
  Tries to find the position of the beginning of the comment at the
   end of LINE, if there is one. START and END delimit the search. END
   defaults to the end of the line. If INSIDE-STRING is non-nil, it is
   assumed that we're inside a string before we began (if so, INSIDE-STRING
   is set to the character which will terminate the string (#\" or #\|).
   SPLAT-BAR-COUNT is the number of unbalanced begin balanced comments
   (#|'s) that have been seen so far.

 To see GNU-Emacs (and some lesser imitations) die miserably, put the
 cursor before the # on the next line, and try doing C-M-f or C-M-e. Ha!

GET-COMMENT-POSITION [function]
   (LINE FILE LINE-NO &OPTIONAL (START 0) END)
  Returns the position of the beginning of the semicolon variety comment
   on this line.

LINE-END [function]
   (LINE FILE LINE-NO &OPTIONAL (START 0) END)
  Returns the position of where in LINE to end the comparison.
   If the comparison should end at the end of the line, returns NIL.
   START, if supplied, is where to start looking for the end.

NULL-STRING [function]
   (STRING &OPTIONAL (START 0) END)
  Returns T if STRING is the null string "" between START and END.

COMPARE-LINES [function]
   (FILE-1 LINE-NO-1 FILE-2 LINE-NO-2)
  Intelligently compare two lines. If *ignore-case* is T, uses
   case-insensitive comparison. If *ignore-whitespace* is T, ignores
   spaces and tabs at the beginning of the line. If *ignore-comments* 
   is T, tries to ignore comments at the end of the line.

 ********************************
 Main Routine *******************
 ********************************

SOURCE-COMPARE [function]
   (FILENAME-1 FILENAME-2 &KEY (OUTPUT-STREAM *STANDARD-OUTPUT*)
    (IGNORE-CASE *IGNORE-CASE*) (IGNORE-WHITESPACE *IGNORE-WHITESPACE*)
    (IGNORE-COMMENTS *IGNORE-COMMENTS*)
    (IGNORE-BLANK-LINES *IGNORE-BLANK-LINES*) (PRINT-CONTEXT *PRINT-CONTEXT*)
    (PRINT-FANCY-HEADER *PRINT-FANCY-HEADER*))
  Compares the contents of the two files, outputting a report of what lines
   must be changed to bring the files into agreement. The report is similar
   to that generated by 'diff': Lines of the forms
      n1 a n3,n4
      n1,n2 d n3
      n1,n2 c n3,n4
   (where a is ADD, d is DELETE, and c is CHANGE) are followed by the
   lines affected in the first (left) file flagged by '<' then all the
   lines affected in the second (right) file flagged by '>'. If PRINT-CONTEXT
   is T, will print out some additional contextual information, such as 
   additional lines before and after the affected text and the definition
   most likely to be affected by the changes. If PRINT-FANCY-HEADER is T,
   prints the file-author and file-write-date in the header. The report is
   output to OUTPUT-STREAM. Returns T if the files were "identical",
   NIL otherwise.
   If IGNORE-CASE is T, uses a case insensitive comparison. 
   If IGNORE-WHITESPACE is T, ignores spaces and tabs that occur at the
   beginning of the line. If IGNORE-COMMENTS is T, tries to ignore
   comments at the end of the line. If *dont-ignore-major-comments* is T, will
   also ignore major comments (comments with a semicolon at char 0 of the
   line). If IGNORE-BLANK-LINES is T, will ignore blank lines in both
   files, including lines that are effectively blank because of ignored 
   comments.

SOURCE-COMPARE-INTERNAL [function]
   (FILE-1 FILE-2 &KEY (STREAM *STANDARD-OUTPUT*) IGNORE-CASE
    IGNORE-WHITESPACE IGNORE-COMMENTS IGNORE-BLANK-LINES PRINT-CONTEXT)
  A greedy implementation of LCS (longest common substring) suitably
   modified for source comparison. It is similar to the standard
   O(n^2) dynamic programming algorithm, but we don't actually keep
   distances or an explicit table. We assume that what has matched so
   far is a correct match. When we encounter a difference, we find the
   closest next match, where "close" is defined in terms of some
   metric. Two common metrics are max(x,y) and x+y, where x is a line number
   from file-2 and y is a line number from file-1. The former leads to 
   expanding (exploring) the table by increasing rectangles, and the
   latter by increasing triangles:
                     #####          #
                         #           #
                         #            #
                         #             #
   The average case running time of this algorithm is O(m+n), where m and n
   are the lengths of the two files. This seems to hold in practice. Worst
   case, of course, is still O(n^2), but this hardly ever occurs for source
   comparison. The metric is implemented by *greedy-metric*,
   which is either FIND-NEXT-RECTILINEAR-MATCH or FIND-NEXT-DIAGONAL-MATCH.

 ********************************
 The Metrics ********************
 ********************************

FIND-NEXT-DIAGONAL-MATCH [function]
   (FILE-1 START-1 FILE-2 START-2)
  First difference detected, look ahead for a match [x+y version].

FIND-DIAGONAL-MATCH [function]
   (SUM FILE-1 START-1 EOF-1 FILE-2 START-2 EOF-2)
  Explores the diagonal with left-corner start-1 start-2 and index (x+y)
   equal to sum, searching for a match. Returns the match if found.

FIND-NEXT-RECTILINEAR-MATCH [function]
   (FILE-1 START-1 FILE-2 START-2)
  First difference detected, look ahead for a match [max(x,y) version].

FIND-LINEAR-MATCH [function]
   (FILE LINE-START LINE-END COMP-FILE COMP-LINE-NO)
  Proceeds linearly in file from line-start to line-end until it 
   finds a match against comp-line-no of comp-file.

FOUND-MATCH [function]
   (FILE-1 LINE-1 FILE-2 LINE-2)
  Check if we've found a match by verifying that the next few lines
   are identical. If *minimum-match-length* is more than 1, has the
   effect of grouping together differences separated only by one 
   matching line.

 ********************************
 Line Contexts ******************
 ********************************

START-CONTEXT [function]
   (FILE LINE-NO)
  Walks backwards from LINE-NO until it finds the beginning of a 
   definition (a line with a left-parenthesis on char 0).

 ********************************
 Report Generator ***************
 ********************************

DRAW-HEADER [function]
   (FILENAME-1 FILENAME-2 &KEY (STREAM *STANDARD-OUTPUT*) PRINT-FANCY-HEADER)
  Draw the header for the source compare report.

TIME-STRING [function]
   (UNIVERSAL-TIME)

DRAW-BAR [function]
   (&OPTIONAL (STREAM *STANDARD-OUTPUT*))
  Draws a dash across the line.

PRINT-RANGE [function]
   (START END &OPTIONAL (STREAM *STANDARD-OUTPUT*))
  Prints a representation of the range from START to END.

PRINT-DIFFERENCES [function]
   (FILE-1 START-1 END-1 FILE-2 START-2 END-2 &OPTIONAL
    (STREAM *STANDARD-OUTPUT*))
  Print the differences in the two files in a format similar to diff.

PRINT-FILE-SEGMENT [function]
   (FILE START END &OPTIONAL (STREAM *STANDARD-OUTPUT*) (LEFT-MARGIN ""))
  Prints the region of FILE from START to END.

 *EOF*
