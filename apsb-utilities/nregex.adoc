 nregex.lisp - My 4/8/92 attempt at a Lisp based regular expression
               parser. 

               This regular expression parser operates by taking a
               regular expression and breaking it down into a list
               consisting of lisp expressions and flags.  The list
               of lisp expressions is then taken in turned into a
               lambda expression that can be later applied to a
               string argument for parsing.
 May  5 1993 mrose - added eval-when at defvar *regex-debug*
      Moved defvars of *regex-groups* and *regex-groupings* to
      before the function regex, to eliminate compiler warnings.
      Export symbols.

 First we create a copy of macros to help debug the beast

'(REGEX REGEX-COMPILE) [exported symbols (eval-when (COMPILE-TOPLEVEL
                                                     LOAD-TOPLEVEL
                                                     EXECUTE))]

*REGEX-DEBUG* [variable (eval-when (COMPILE-TOPLEVEL LOAD-TOPLEVEL EXECUTE))]

 Declare the global variables for storing the paren index list.


*REGEX-GROUPS* [variable] value: (MAKE-ARRAY 10)

*REGEX-GROUPINGS* [variable] value: 0

INFO [macro]
   (MESSAGE &REST ARGS)


 Declare a simple interface for testing.  You probably wouldn't want
 to use this interface unless you were just calling this once.


REGEX [function]
   (EXPRESSION STRING)
  Usage: (regex <expression> <string)
   This function will call regex-compile on the expression and then apply
   the string to the returned lambda list.


 Declare some simple macros to make the code more readable.


*REGEX-SPECIAL-CHARS* [variable] value: "?*+.()[]\\${}"

ADD-EXP [macro]
   (LIST)
  Add an item to the end of expression


 Now for the main regex compiler routine.


REGEX-COMPILE [function]
   (SOURCE &KEY (ANCHORED NIL))
  Usage: (regex-compile <expression> [ :anchored (t/nil) ])
       This function take a regular expression (supplied as source) and
       compiles this into a lambda list that a string argument can then
       be applied to.  It is also possible to compile this lambda list
       for better performance or to save it as a named function for later
       use


 Define a function that will take a quoted character and return
 what the real character should be plus how much of the source
 string was used.  If the result is a set of characters, return an
 array of bits indicating which characters should be set.  If the
 expression is one of the sub-group matches return a
 list-expression that will provide the match.  


REGEX-QUOTED [function]
   (CHAR-STRING &OPTIONAL (INVERT NIL))
  Usage: (regex-quoted <char-string> &optional invert)
       Returns either the quoted character or a simple bit vector of bits set for
       the matching values
