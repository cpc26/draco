	FIRE (file repository) utility
	      ~~   ~~

	Synopsis:

	  [having always hated block comments, i've always wanted to
	  substitute the lyrics to the theme from Gilligan's Island.
	  alas, not today.  -- fwy]

	  the FIRE utility enables one to associate arbitrary internal
	  representations, e.g. hash tables and alists, with external
	  repositories, e.g. files and streams.  these associations
	  are represented by instances of the FIRE class.

	  an instance of FIRE is essentially a read-only data structure,
	  i.e. once it is created, it is usually modified only by the
	  FIRE utility.  the instance therefore associates the specified
	  internal representation with a particular file or stream.
	  we provide the following operators: fire-copy, fire-load,
	  fire-query, fire-update, and make-fire.

	  fire-copy (method) creates and returns a copy of an instance
	  of FIRE.  the returned instance may associate a different
	  file/stream with the internal representation.

	  fire-load (method) loads the FIRE's file/stream using the
	  FIRE's load-fn and the appropriate (re)load-parameters.

	  fire-query (macro) insures that the internal representation
	  is at least as new as its associated file/stream before
	  invoking the specified query.

	  fire-update (method) overwrites the FIRE's file/stream with
	  the contents of the internal representation.

	  make-fire (function) creates and returns an instance of FIRE.


	Default Behavior:

	  fire-update signals an error unless an update-fn has been
	  specified.  in other words, file/stream repositories are
	  read-only by default.

	  init-fn and clear-fn both default to nil.  in other words, the
	  internal representation is assumed to be self-(re)initializing,
	  i.e. the act of "loading" the forms in the file repository
	  should create/clear the internal representation by default.


	Creating New Repositories:

	  since FIRE instances are basically read-only objects, associating
	  a new file/stream with an internal representation is not a trivial
	  process.  one cannot simply (setf (file ...) ...).

	  there are two scenarios to consider: (1) the internally represented
	  data are deemed superior to the repository's data, but the user
	  does not wish to destroy the current repository, i.e. invoke the
	  update-fn, and (2) a new repository is deemed superior to the
	  current one and we wish to replace the internally represented data
	  with the new repository's data.

	  in both cases, the correct approach is to create a second FIRE
	  instance, perhaps via the fire-copy method.  the internal
	  representation can then be written out (via the second instance's
	  update-fn) or refreshed (the first time fire-query is invoked on
	  the second instance).  the application is responsible for any
	  bookkeeping that may be necessary.


FIRE [class]
  parent classes: (STANDARD-CLASS)
  
	associates an external repository (a file or
	a stream) with its internal representation
  slots:
   FILE   reader: FILE
     specifies the external file repository
   DOCUMENTATION   reader: DOC-STRING
     description of the data contained in FILE
   INIT-FN   accessor: INIT-FN
     initializes the internal representation
   LOAD-FN   accessor: LOAD-FN
     (funcall LOAD-FN FILE) reads FILE into memory
   LOAD-PARAMETERS   accessor: LOAD-PARAMETERS
     a keyword-value plist for LOAD-FN's 1st call
   RELOAD-PARAMETERS   accessor: RELOAD-PARAMETERS
     like LOAD-PARAMETERS but for subsequent calls
   SYNCH-TIME   accessor: SYNCH-TIME
     last time FILE was known to be up-to-date
   CLEAR-FN   accessor: CLEAR-FN
     clears the internal representation
   UPDATE-FN   accessor: UPDATE-FN
     (funcall UPDATE-FN FILE) updates FILE
   UPDATE-PARAMETERS   accessor: UPDATE-PARAMETERS
     a keyword-value plist for UPDATE-FN calls

PRINT-OBJECT [method]
   ((FIRE FIRE) (STREAM STREAM))

SHARED-INITIALIZE [BEFORE method]
   ((FIRE FIRE) SLOT-NAMES &REST INITARGS)
  discourages reinitialization of (file fire)
  (DECLARE (IGNORE SLOT-NAMES))
  (AVER (LIST INITARGS))

FIRE-CLEAR [method]
   ((FIRE FIRE))
  invoke (clear-fn fire)

FIRE-COPY [method]
   ((FIRE FIRE) &KEY (FILE (FILE FIRE)))
  return a copy of fire with (file fire) initialized to file
  (AVER (STREAM-SPEC FILE))

FIRE-LOAD [method]
   ((FIRE FIRE) &KEY (FORCE NIL))
  
	load or reload (file fire) if necessary or if :force is non-nil.
	return (file fire)'s file-write-date if it was loaded or reloaded,
	and nil if no load was performed.  :force defaults to nil.
  (AVER (BOOLEAN FORCE))

FIRE-UPDATE [method]
   ((FIRE FIRE))
  
	invoke (update-fn fire) and return the new file-write-date
	of (file fire); if (update-fn fire) does not exist, an error
	is signaled.

FIRE-QUERY [macro]
   (FIRE QUERY)
  load or reload (file fire), if necessary, before invoking query

COPY-STREAM-TO-FILE [function]
   (STREAM FILE)

FILE-SIZE [function]
   (FILE-SPEC &KEY (ELEMENT-TYPE :DEFAULT))
  
	return size of file-spec;
	return nil if file-spec does not name a file that can be opened
  (AVER (FILE-SPEC FILE-SPEC))

NULL-FILE [function]
   (FILE-SPEC)
  return nil unless file-spec names an empty file
  (AVER (FILE-SPEC FILE-SPEC))

MAKE-FIRE [function]
   (STREAM-SPEC &REST ARGS &KEY DOCUMENTATION INIT-FN LOAD-FN LOAD-PARAMETERS
    RELOAD-PARAMETERS CLEAR-FN UPDATE-FN)
  create and return an instance of FIRE
  (DECLARE (IGNORE DOCUMENTATION INIT-FN LOAD-FN LOAD-PARAMETERS
            RELOAD-PARAMETERS CLEAR-FN UPDATE-FN))
  (AVER (STREAM-SPEC STREAM-SPEC) (LIST ARGS))
