 Initial revision

 History:
 Apr 12 1992 mrose, created, changed package from USER to NORVIG, renamed
                    DEBUG to DBG-ON, and UNDEBUG to DBG-OFF, changed
                    implementation, but not interface of dbg and dbg-indent.
; Reduce - Support :key keyword for the REDUCE function

REDUCE* [function]
   (FN SEQ FROM-END START END KEY INIT INIT-P)

REDUCE [function]
   (FUNCTION SEQUENCE
             &KEY
             FROM-END
             START
             END
             KEY
             (INITIAL-VALUE NIL INITIAL-VALUE-P))

REDUCE-VECT [function]
   (FN SEQ FROM-END START END KEY INIT INIT-P)

REDUCE-LIST [function]
   (FN SEQ FROM-END START END KEY INIT INIT-P)

 The Debugging Output Facility:
 debug functions based on "Paradigms of AI Programming" by Peter Norvig.

 The function "dbg" prints output in the same way as "format", but will only
 print when debugging output is desired.  Each call to dbg is accompanied by
 an identifier that is used to specify a class of debugging messages.
 The functions "dbg-on" and "dbg-off" are used to add or remove message
 classes to the list of classes that should be printed. 

 A call to dbg will result in output if the first argument, the
 identifier, is one that was specified in a call to dbg-on.  The other
 arguments are a format string followed by a list of arguments to
 be printed according to the format string.  In other words,
 functions will include calls to debug like:
    (dbg :foo "The current goal is: ~a" goal)
 If debugging has been enabled with (dbg-on :foo), then calls to
 debug with the identifier :foo will print output.  The output is
 turned off with (debug-off :foo).

 Sometimes it is easier to view debugging output if it is indented according
 to some pattern, such as the depth of nested calls to a function.  To 
 generate indented output, the function debug-indent is used.

*DBG-IDS* [variable]
  Identifiers used by dbg.

DBG [function]
   (ID FORMAT-STRING &REST ARGS)
  Print debugging info if (DBG-ON ID) has been specified.

DBG-INDENT [function]
   (ID INDENT FORMAT-STRING &REST ARGS)
  Print indented debugging info if (DBG-ON ID) has been specified.

DBG-ON [function]
   (&REST IDS)
  Start debug output on the given ids.

DBG-OFF [function]
   (&REST IDS)
  Stop debug on the ids.  With no ids, stop debug altogether.
