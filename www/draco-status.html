<H1>Status of the Draco Project</H1>

The initial development of Draco was completed in December 1993 and the 
project is now in a maintenance and distribution phase. Funding for
the only full time person on the project <A HREF="draco-team.html#Felix">(Yen)</A>
has been used, so further work will be somewhat limited. <P>

Draco is very much a <I>research</I> project. It is not off-the-shelf
software. If you intend to use it, you'll have to do some
"development" work in writing new Draco procedures, primitives and
implementations. We'll assist you as much as we can in this. <P>

We're still very much interested in this project and welcome comments, suggestions, 
etc. Please send email to <I>miller@stsci.edu</I>. Even if you don't 
download Draco, your opinions and experiences with automating scientific
data reduction and analysis are of interest.
