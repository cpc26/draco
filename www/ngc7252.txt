NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of the core of the peculiar galaxy
NGC 7252 reveals a striking "mini-spiral" disk of gas and stars, and
about 40 exceptionally bright and young globular star clusters.
The visible light image was taken with the Wide Field and Planetary
Camera in PC mode on October 10, 1992.  The false-color has been
subject to computer image reconstruction.  The strong spiral structure
is 10,000 light-years across (7 arc seconds); the entire picture is
46,000 light-years across.  The clusters are 60 light-years in diameter 
(0.04 arc seconds) and are the same size as globular clusters that
orbit our Milky Way galaxy.
