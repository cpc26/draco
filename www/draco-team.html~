<A NAME="Glenn"><B>Glenn Miller</B></A> is an astronomer with an
interest in applying computer science to scientifc investigations.  He is
Principal Investigator on the Data Reduction Expert Assistant (Draco)
project which is supported by NASA's AISR program. He has authored or
co-authored several articles on the development of HST planning
software and the application of AI techniques to scientific
applications and observatory operations.  At the STScI he is Chief of
the Advance Planning Systems Branch. He was instrumental in the design
and development of the HST Proposal Entry Processor and Spike
Scheduling systems.  He has published in several areas of astronomy
including the initial mass function and stellar birthrate (the
"Miller-Scalo IMF"), abundances in peculiar red giant stars, and the
evolution of galaxies and clusters.  He earned a Ph.D. in Astronomy
from the University of Texas at Austin and was an Assistant Professor
of Astronomy at the University of Virginia prior to joining the STScI
staff in 1983. <P>

<A NAME="Felix"><B>Felix Yen</B></A> 
joined the Space Telescope
Science Institute staff in October 1991 to work on the Draco
project. As a computer scientist, he was the principal designer and
developer of Draco. Upon completion of the initial development of
Draco in November 1993, he left the STScI for Cadre Technologies. He
received a Ph.D. in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from
Brown University in 1991. <P>

<A NAME="Mark"><B>Mark Johnston</B></A>
is an Senior Scientist at the Space
Telescope Science Institute (STScI) where he is Deputy Head of the
Science and Engineering Systems Division.  He was responsible for the
design and development of both the Proposal Entry Processor (PEP) and
SPIKE HST scheduling system.  He received his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in
1978 with a thesis on HEAO-1 X-ray observations of the Large
Magellanic Cloud.  He received his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in 1978 with a
thesis on HEAO-1 X-ray observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud. He
has extensive experience with satellite data and has authored or
co-authored ~30 papers based on the analysis of HEAO-1 X-ray data. He
developed the data analysis system for the HEAO-1 X-ray modulation
collimator experiment. His other research interests include numerical
hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis in supernovae, statistics and
classification techniques, and the application of advanced software
and computing techniques to astronomical research.  He was an
Assistant Professor of Astronomy at the University of Virginia before
moving to STScI in 1982. <P>

<A NAME="Bob"><B>Robert Hanisch</B></A>
is an Associate Scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute 
(STScI) and is Chief of the Science Software Branch of the Science Computing and 
Research Support Division. He is responsible for both the development of the STSDAS 
software package for HST data analysis and for the day to day operations of all STScI 
scientific computing facilities. Dr. Hanisch has overseen the migration of the HST data 
analysis software from a VMS-dependent system to a totally portable system integrated 
with IRAF. His scientific background is in radio astronomy. He completed his 
Ph.D. at the University of Maryland in 1981 on the topic of diffuse radio emission from 
clusters of galaxies, and continued work on extragalactic radio sources as a post-doctoral 
research fellow at the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands. He has 
been involved with the STSDAS project at the STScI since 1984.  <P>
