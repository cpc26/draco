<H1>Draco - A Data Reduction Expert Assistant</H1>
 <P>
The use of large format detectors, increased access to very large 
astronomical databases, and other developments in observational astronomy 
have led to the situation where many astronomers are overwhelmed by the 
reduction and analysis process. Draco is a novel approach to data reduction 
and analysis which works in conjunction with existing analysis systems such as 
STSDAS/IRAF, IDL, etc. Draco takes
on much of the mechanics of the process, allowing the astronomer to spend 
more time understanding the physical nature of the data.
