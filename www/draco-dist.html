<TITLE>Draco Distribution</TITLE>
<H1>Getting a copy of Draco</H1>

<H2>Operating Systems</H2>
Draco was developed on Sun Sparcstations running Sun OS 4.1.3 (which
is the same as Solaris 1.1). Draco was designed with portability
in mind, so porting to other Unix systems is straightforward.

<H2>Data Analysis Systems</H2>
Draco was tested with STSDAS <A HREF="http://ra.stsci.edu/STSDAS.html">
STSDAS</A>
and <A HREF="http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf-homepage.html">IRAF</A>. 
Interfacing with other systems is straightforward: it is just a matter
of defining the correct "implementations" 
(refer to the <A HREF="draco-pubs.html#DesignDoc">Draco Design Document</A>).

<H2>Resources Required</H2>
If your workstation can run any of the standard data reduction systems,
it can run Draco. You probably already have 16Mb or more of physical
memory, 50Mb or more of virtual memory and several hundred Mb of 
disk space. Draco will run fine in this configuration.
The Draco source files and executable will require about 20Mb of disk space.

<H2>Language</H2>
Draco is written in Common Lisp, specifically Allegro Common Lisp 4.2 beta by
Franz, Inc. The distribution includes an executable image, so you don't need
a Lisp system at your site. <P>

We chose Lisp since it offered
a powerful, high-level development environment that is available on
many different machines. Earlier dialects of Lisp could be justifiably
criticised for being slow, but Common Lisp performs on a par
with other languages (e.g. Fortran and C) and has several
significant advantages. Draco makes extensive
use of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), an object-oriented
system similar to Smalltalk and C++. More information on 
<A HREF="draco-explore.html#Lisp">Lisp</A>
is available. 

<H2>Draco is available as-is</H2>
Draco is a tool for research into the problems of automating
scientific data reduction. 
<B>It is made available "as-is", without
any warranty whatsoever. The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of this program is with you. Should this program prove defective, you
assume the cost of all necessary correction, recovery and repair.</B> <P>

Draco is very much a <I>research</I> project. It is not off-the-shelf
software. If you intend to use it, you'll have to do some
development work in writing new Draco procedures, primitives and
implementations. <P>

Please report any problems to <I>miller@stsci.edu</I>. We're very much interested
in comments, suggestions, etc. Even if you don't 
download Draco, your opinions and experiences with automating scientific
data reduction and analysis are of interest.

<H2>I'm ready - Let me have it!</H2>

<B>Sorry, but this file isn't ready yet...</B> <P>

First, get
<A HREF="/lor/data1/Draco/tar/draco.tar">the distribution file</A> and 
save it locally (e.g. <TT>draco.tar</TT>).

<P>
Then, extract the files with 
<PRE><TT>% tar xvf draco.tar</TT></PRE>
<P>

What will they have then? 
a new directory structure?
then they need to do the logical pathname stuff...
